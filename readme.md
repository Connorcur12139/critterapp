# Critter, A Twitter clone written with [Laravel] in under 10 hours by [@msurguy]

Imagine Twitter is down again. It's dark outside, and how can you tell everyone about that? 
Critter to the rescue. Deploy your own Twitter with Laravel and any cloud service, in minutes! 

##What does this do ?   
It is a PHP/MySQL web application written in Laravel for the purpose of learning. 

The users can register, sign in, post critts, view critts and follow other users.

## How to get this thing running? 
You have few options:
To deploy in the cloud, use Pagodabox or PHPFog and watch my tutorials on [Udemy]
To deploy on the local machine use MAMP, WAMP or Apache/PHP 5.3/MySQL, edit your settings in the application/config folder according to Laravel documentation. Or again, watch my tutorials on [Udemy]
